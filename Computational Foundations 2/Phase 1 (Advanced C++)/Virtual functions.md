Used in the context of inheritance and polymorphism to allow derived classes to override the behavior of the base class function. Purposes: • Interface definition: communicate in the interface definition in header file that this function is intended to be overriden. • Polymorphism: Virtual functions enable polymorphism, allowing objects of derived classes to be treated as objects of the base class while still calling the correct derived class method at runtime. • Code Seperation: Declaring virtual functions in the header file maintains separation between declarations in header (.h) and implementations in source file (.cpp). • Compiler Requirements: To allow proper vtable construction.
