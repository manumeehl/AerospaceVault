Classes and Structs are essential Elements of [[Object Oriented Programming]].

Classes and Structs behave in the exact same way except:

1. Default Access:
	- Classes are *private*
	- Structs are *public*
2. Inheritance
	- Inherited Class members are *private*
	- Inherited Struct members are *public*
3. Usage:
	- There are no strict rules for the usage, but commonly structs are used for data-oriented types and classes for more complex, behaviour-oriented types.
