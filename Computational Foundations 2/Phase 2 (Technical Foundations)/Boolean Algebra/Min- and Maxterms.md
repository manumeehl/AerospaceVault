##### Minterms
Minterm is the product of various different literals in which each literal occurs exactly once. The output result of the minterm functions is 1. It is represented by m. To represent a function, we perform a sum of minterms also called the Sum Of Products (SOP).

##### Maxterm
Maxterm is the sum of various different literals in which each literal occurs exactly once. The output result of the maxterm functions is 0. It is represented by M. To represent a function, we perform product of maxterms also called Product of Sum (POS).

Minterms and maxterms are fundamental concepts used to represent and simplify Boolean functions, as they provide a systematic way to express logical expressions.

##### When to use SOPs or POSs
- SOP expressions are used when minimizing expressions for functions with mainly 1s
- POS expressions are used when optimizing functions with mainly 0s
