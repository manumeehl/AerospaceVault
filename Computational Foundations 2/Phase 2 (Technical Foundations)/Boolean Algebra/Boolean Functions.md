"A Boolean function is a function of sets ℬ 𝑛 → ℬ 𝑚 mapping a set of inputs 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, 𝑑, … ∈ ℬ 𝑛 to a set of outputs 𝑓1 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, 𝑑, … , 𝑓2 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, 𝑑, … ∈ ℬ 𝑚."

- For every Boolean functions exists a truth table with all combinations of inputs and outputs
- A function with n inputs has 2 𝑛 distinct input vectors

The output space dimensions can be considered individually (e.g., the function can be decomposed into multiple functions ℬ 𝑛 → ℬ of the from 𝑓𝑖 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, 𝑑, …
