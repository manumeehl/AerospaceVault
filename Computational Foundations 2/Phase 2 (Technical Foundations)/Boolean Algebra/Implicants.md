### Implicants
An implicant is a product/[[Min- and Maxterms|minterm]] in Sum of Products (SOP) or [[Min- and Maxterms|maxterm]] in a Product of Sums (POS) of a Boolean function.

##### Prime Implicants
A prime implicant is an implicant that cannot be further reduced or combined with other implicants while still covering all the minterms (input combinations) for which the Boolean function is true. Prime implicants are important in the process of logical minimization.

##### Essential Prime Implicants
Essential Prime implicants When a Prime Implicant (PI) contains at least one complete conjunction (a '1' field) which is not part of another PI, then this PI is called an "Essential (or Core) Prime Implicant
