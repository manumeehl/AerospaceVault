> Definition: A signal is a physically observable observed through time
> Definition: A digital signal is such a function where the output is from the set {0,1}

- Two unary functions of Boolean values exist: identity and negation.
- A negotiation can be easily built using a transistor

Binary logic gates in electric circuits:
- AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR

A Boolean expression with variables a,b,c... can be implemented as a circuit by adding a signal lane for each variable and then filling gates for the operations in the expression connecting their output to the place where the evaluated result shall be.
