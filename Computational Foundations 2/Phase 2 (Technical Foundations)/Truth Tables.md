- A truth table is a tabular representation of the possible inputs and their corresponding outputs for a logical operation or a Boolean function.
- Each row in the truth table lists a unique combination of input values and the resulting output value.
- Truth tables are used to analyze and verify the behavior of logic gates, digital circuits, and Boolean expressions.
- They provide a systematic way to ensure that a logic design or function behaves as expected for all possible input combinations.

Example: Truth Table for the XOR-Gate

|Input A|Input B|Output|
|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|
|0|1|1|
|1|0|1|
|1|1|0|
