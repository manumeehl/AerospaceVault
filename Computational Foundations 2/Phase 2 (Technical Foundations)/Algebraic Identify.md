The Algebraic identity describes the behaviour of a circuit similarly to a truth table, but in a single formula.

Example: XOR Gate

**1. Truth Table:**

|Input A|Input B|Output (A ⊕ B)|
|---|---|---|
|0|0|0|
|0|1|1|
|1|0|1|
|1|1|0|

**2. Identify Output Conditions:** The output is 1 when either A is 0 and B is 1 (¬A ∧ B) OR when A is 1 and B is 0 (A ∧ ¬B).

**3. Combine Expressions:** The algebraic identity for XOR is:

**A ⊕ B = ¬A ∧ B ∨ A ∧ ¬B**
