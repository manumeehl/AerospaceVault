The Hamming distance in computer science is a metric that measures the difference between two strings of equal length. It is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different.

Formally, the Hamming distance between two strings `s` and `t` of equal length `n` is the number of positions `i` such that `s[i] != t[i]`.

For example, consider the strings "1101" and "1001". The Hamming distance between these two strings is 1, because only the third position (counting from 0) has a different symbol.

The Hamming distance has several applications in computer science, including:

1. **Error detection and correction**: The Hamming distance can be used to detect and correct errors in data transmission, as it measures the number of bits that need to be changed to transform one string into another.
    
2. **Coding theory**: Hamming codes are a family of linear error-correcting codes that use the Hamming distance to detect and correct errors in data.
    
3. **Bioinformatics**: The Hamming distance can be used to measure the similarity between DNA or protein sequences, which is useful in comparing and aligning biological sequences.
    
4. **Cryptography**: The Hamming distance can be used to analyze the security of cryptographic algorithms by measuring the diffusion, which is the property that a small change in the input should result in a large change in the output.
    

The Hamming distance is a useful concept in computer science and has many practical applications in various fields.
