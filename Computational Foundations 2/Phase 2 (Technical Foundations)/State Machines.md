### Mealy Machine
> The output is determined by both the input and the current state

+Fewer states required, can use data directly
+Can be much faster (do not have to wait for next cycle)

---
### Moore Machine
> The output only depends on the current state

+Safer to use (change output only with new cycle)
-Moore Machines may require more logic to decode state into outputs
