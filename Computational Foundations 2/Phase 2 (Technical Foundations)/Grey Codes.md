In computer science, a Gray code, also known as a reflected binary code, is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit position.

The key properties of Gray codes are:

1. **One-Bit Difference**: In a Gray code, two consecutive numbers differ in only one bit position. This means that going from one number to the next, only a single bit needs to be flipped.
    
2. **Cycle Property**: When the sequence wraps around, the first and last values also differ in only one bit position, forming a cycle.
    

The simplest example of a Gray code is the binary-reflected Gray code (BRGC), which can be defined recursively as follows:

- The 1-bit BRGC is simply the two values "0" and "1".
- To generate the (n+1)-bit BRGC from the n-bit BRGC, you take the n-bit BRGC, write it in reverse order, and then prepend a 0 to the first half and a 1 to the second half.

For example, the 3-bit BRGC is: 000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100.

Gray codes have several applications in computer science and engineering, including:

1. **Error-Resistant Encoding**: Gray codes are useful in applications where errors can occur during data transmission or storage, as a single bit error will only result in a one-unit change in the decoded value.
    
2. **Digital Circuit Design**: Gray codes are used in the design of digital circuits, particularly in the control of stepper motors and other devices that require a sequence of states.
    
3. **Combinatorial Optimization**: Gray codes are used in various optimization algorithms, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem, to explore the search space efficiently.
    
4. **Data Compression**: Gray codes can be used in data compression algorithms to exploit the one-bit difference property.
