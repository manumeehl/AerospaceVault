>Relational Databases organizes data into “tables” of rows and columns, enforcing relationships between entities through keys while utilizing SQL for data management and query operations.

### Difference of relational databases to tables
• No Duplicates
• No Order of Rows

### Core value of RDBMS
• They allow multiple users from the beginning
• They ensure that data is consistent and durably stored
• They fit very well to the object-oriented setting
• They allow for declaring results in terms of properties and not in terms of computational thinking
• The database is writing the fastest imperative program it can come up with to give you the data.
