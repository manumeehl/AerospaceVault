### General Information 
Information is conveyed electrically in the human body: 
- Cardiac beat initiation 
- Excitation of muscles 
- Impulse transmission on the nerve cells 
- Neurons firing in the brain 

----
### Types of Muscles 
- __Smooth Muscle__ $\rightarrow$ muscle around organs; enduring, slow processes
- __Striated Muscle__ $\rightarrow$ fast and powerful contractions; skeletal muscle or cardiac muscle

Muscle contraction is initiated by an electrical nerve stimulus from the central nervous system. It is irrelevant for the muscles if the electrical stimulus originates from the central nervous system or an outside source.

| Components                     | Purpose                                                                   | Location                                         | Normal Beat Rate |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| _Sinoatrial Node (SN)_         | primary excitation unit                                                   | connected to the muscles of the atria            | 60-80 $BPM$      |
| _Atrioventricular node (AVC)_  | secondary excitation unit, starts when the sinus node fails               | connection between sinus node and ventricles     | 40-50 $BPM$      |
| _His-Bundle (bundle branches)_ | Transduces impulses from the SC and AVC to the muscles of the ventricles  | located in the wall between atria and ventricles | 20-30 $BPM$      |

### Body [[Resistance]]
- Results from the [[Resistance]] of the skin and the resistance of the rest of the body
- The skin layers act as a [[Capacitance]], making the body resistance equivalent to a [[Capacitor Series Connection|C-R series circuit]]
- The resistance value decreases with salt water on the skin, tissue composition, and the path the current takes through the body

| Current Path | Body resistance (in $\Omega$) |

| _Hand-Hand_  | 1000                          |
| _Foot-Foot_  | 1000                          |
| _Hand-Feet_  | 750                           |
| _Hand-Body_  | 500                           |
| _Hands-Body_ | 250                           |
