#Component
### Main Tasks
- limit electric [[Current]]
- measure current based on the [[Voltage]] in a circuit
- divide electric [[Current]] or [[Voltage]] in a circuit ([[Resistor Parallel Connection|current divider]] or [[Resistor Series Connection|voltage divider]])
- convert electrical [[Energy]] into thermal [[Energy]] 
- adjust operating points if transistors or operational amplifiers respectively 
- provide damping in oscillating circuits

### Important Parameters
- Tolerance 
- Maximum power dissipation
- Temperature coefficient 
- Dielectric strength
