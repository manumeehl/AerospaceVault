### Definition of Capacitance
Capacitance is the ability of an object, material, or [[Capacitor]] to store electric [[Charge]]. In general it holds that: 
$$
C = \frac{Q}{V}
$$
In a parallel-plate capacitor the capacitance is defined as: 
$$
C = \epsilon \cdot \frac{A}{d}
$$
With $A$ being the area of the plates and $d$ their separation. $\epsilon$ is the permittivity defined as: 
$$
\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \cdot \epsilon_r
$$
Where $\epsilon_0$ is a general constant: 
$$
\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \frac{As}{Vm}
$$
$\epsilon_r$ is a material dependent property, some examples include: 

| Material | $\epsilon_r$ |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Vacuum   | 1            |
| Air      | 1            |
| Pertinax | 5            |
| Mica     | 7            |
| Silicon  | 12           |
| Water    | 80           |
