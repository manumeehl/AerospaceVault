In the so called hysteresis loop one can see how a material behaves when exposed to a coercive [[Magnetic Field]]. In the initial magnetisation curve the [[Magnetic Flux Density]] behaves according to the formula: 
$$
\vec{B}=\mu_0\mu_r \cdot \vec{H}
$$
Once the material is magnetised the magnetic field can be removed. However, a residual [[Magnetic Flux Density]] will remain; $B_r$. To demagnetise the material another coercive magnetic field is needed; $-H_c$. If an even stronger field is applied this entire cycle can play out in reverse, thus forming the loop.

The area of the hysteresis loop is proportional to $B \cdot H$.
