Also know as Reluctance it is the proportionality factor between the [[Magnetomotive Force]] and [[Magnetic Flux]]. 
$$
\Theta = R_m \cdot \Phi \iff R_m = \frac{\Theta}{\Phi}
$$

It is can be calculated with the formula: 
$$
R_m = \frac{1}{\mu_0\mu_r} \cdot \frac{l}{A}
$$

### Reluctance \[$H^{-1}$]
$$
H^{-1} = A\cdot V^{-1} \cdot s^{-1}
$$
