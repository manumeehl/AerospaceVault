The [[Voltage]] induced by a [[Magnetic Flux]] can be calculated by the following formula: 
$$
v_i(t) = \frac{d\Psi(t)}{dt}
$$
Where $\Psi$ is the flux linkage, defined as: 
$$
\Psi(t) = N \cdot \Phi(t) = N \cdot B(t) \cdot A(t)
$$
The flux linkage can also be defined by the [[Inductance]] $L$:
$$
\Psi(t) = L \cdot i(t)
$$
This also explains the phenomenon of self-[[Inductance|inductance]] as when the [[Current]] to a coil is cut the [[Magnetic Field]] starts to collapse. That change in [[Magnetic Flux Density]] (cf. formula below) induces a [[Voltage]] and therefore [[Current]] in the coil: 
$$
v_i(t) = N \cdot A \cdot \frac{dB(t)}{dt}
$$
