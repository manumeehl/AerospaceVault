### Definition of Current
Current is the amount of [[Charge]] transported per unit time. 
$$
I = \frac{Q}{t} = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}
$$

$$
i(t) = \frac{dQ(t)}{dt}
$$
This is the function representation of charge. Note that as it is the derivative a small amount of charge in a very small amount of time can still lead to very high current. 
$$
1 A = 1 \frac{C}{s} \iff 1 C = 1 As
$$

### Ampère \[$A$]
$$
U = R \cdot I
$$
[[Voltage]], [[Resistance]], and Current are linked via [[Ohm's Law]].
