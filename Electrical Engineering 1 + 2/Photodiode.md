#Component 
A photodiode is a kind of [[Diode]] that has a pn-junction with a small enough depletion zone that excitation by light is sufficient to overcome it. ![[Screenshot 2024-05-26 at 13.05.07.png]]

### Application: Optocouplers
In combination with a [[Light Emitting Diode|LED]] high power circuits can be sensed and controlled purely optically since the signal transmission takes place purely optically. ![[Screenshot 2024-05-26 at 13.09.29.png]]
