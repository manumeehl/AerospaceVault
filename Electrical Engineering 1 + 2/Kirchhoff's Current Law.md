#Law 
Kirchhoff's [[Current]] Law enables the analysis of currents at nodes, specifically: 
$$
\sum_{\nu = 0}^{n} I_{\nu} = 0 \implies \sum I_{in} - \sum I_{out} = 0
$$

If the current goes into a node it is positive and if it goes out of the node it is negative. Together with [[Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]] is used in [[DC-Network-Analysis]].
