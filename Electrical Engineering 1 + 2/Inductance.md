Inductance is the tendency of an electrical conductor to oppose a change in the electric [[Current]] flowing through it. Thereby an inductor (i. e. a coil) can store [[Energy]] in the form of an electric field and release it by [[Faraday's Law of Induction|self-inductance]]. It can be calculated by: 
$$
L = \frac{N^2}{R_m}
$$
