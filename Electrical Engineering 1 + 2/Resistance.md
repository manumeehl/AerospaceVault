### Definition of Resistance
Electrical [[Energy]] is converted into another form of energy during [[Charge]] transport in the direction of the [[Voltage]].

The inverse of resistance is [[Conductivity]].

Due to electrical resistance heat is generated by scattering of electrons in the crystal lattice of the material.

### Ohm \[$\Omega$]
$$
1\Omega = 1 \frac{V}{A}
$$

_Specific Resistance:_
The resistance of a conductor can be calculated using a material coefficient $\rho$ and the conductor geometry
$$
R = \rho \cdot \frac{l}{A}
$$
where $\rho$ is the specific resistivity of the conductor material.

### Ohmmeter \[$\Omega m$]
$$
1 \ \Omega mm^2/m = 1 \times 10^{-6} \ \Omega m
$$

__Material coefficients of some electrical conductors:__

| Metals /  Alloys | $\rho_{20}$ in $\Omega mm^2 / m$ | $\alpha_{20}$ in $\degree C^{-1}$ |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Silver           | $0.016$                          | $0.0038$                          |
| Copper           | $0.0175$                         | $0.0039$                          |
| Aluminium        | $0.028$                          | $0.0038$                          |
| Wolfram          | $0.055$                          | $0.0041$                          |
| Manganin         | $0.43$                           | $1 \times 10^{-5}$                |
| Constantan       | $0.05$                           | $-3 \times 10^{-5}$               |
Here $\rho_{20}$ is the reference value at 20$\degree C$ and $\alpha_{20}$ is the temperature coefficient.

### Temperature Dependent Resistance
The temperature dependency of the resistance can therefore be linearly approximated: 
$$
\rho(\zeta) = \rho_{20} \ \cdot \ \ [1 + \alpha_{20} \cdot (\zeta - 20\degree C)] 
$$
$$R(\zeta) = R_{20} \ \cdot \ \ [1 + \alpha_{20} \cdot (\zeta - 20\degree C)]$$

In reality resistance is not only induced by conductors but by [[Resistor]] components as well.
