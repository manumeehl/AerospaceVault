### Dangerous Installation 
One must keep distance to these installations even if [[Safety Signs]] are absent: 
- DB railroad systems: 15000$V$ AC, life threatening [[Voltage]] in the vicinity of the wire
- Underground and trams: (In München) 750$V$ DC, life threatening if touched
- High-voltage pylons, underground cables and power engineering installations
- All types of defective electrical equipment

### Dangers to the [[Human Anatomy|Human Organism]]
- In medicine; Low-Voltage (<1000$V$) vs. High-Voltage (>1000$V$)
- AC is more dangerous than DC because the muscles react to the alternating stimuli
- DC leads to the same damage when the current is applied longer and at a higher [[Electrical Current Density|Current Density]]
- Touching a live conductor can lead to __tetanic muscle contraction__ causing muscles to contract to such an extent that strains, muscle ruptures, and bone fractures can occur $\rightarrow$ the conductor can be become inextricably clasped
- __Secondary accidents__ can occur when casualties fall from ladders or equipment parts

---- 
### Low Voltage Accidents 
- Below 1000$V$ damage is mainly caused by the disturbance of the heart 
- At a usual heart rate of 1$Hz$ a 50$Hz$ mains current causes a significant increase in the excitation frequency $\rightarrow$ __Ventricular fibrillation__ (heart muscles can no longer transport blood)
- Respiratory muscles also tremor $\rightarrow$ death by suffocation 

----
### High Voltage Accidents
- Above 1000$V$, damage by combustion and charring predominates 
- Electric arcs reach temperatures from 3000$°C$ to 20000$°C$
- Current marks result at entry and exit points 
- On the current paths tissue is destroyed 
- Blood could by boiled away $\rightarrow$ delayed death due to kidney damage

### Safety Rules for Handling Electrical Current 
1. Convince yourself of the perfect condition of the operating equipment
2. Only operate parts intended for operation (no by-passing of safety features, bridging of parts of the device)
3. Do not operate wet equipment (hands and feet should also be dry)
4. In case of malfunctions, immediately disconnect the power supply safely
5. Report malfunctions and damage
6. No tinkering with electrical systems or equipment
7. Switch cabinets, fuse boxes and distribution boxes must not be opened
8. Do not work alone on live equipment
