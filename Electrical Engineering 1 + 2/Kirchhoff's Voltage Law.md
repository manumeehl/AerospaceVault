#Law 
Kirchhoff's [[Voltage]] Law is enables the calculation of component voltages inside a mesh. A mesh is a closed circus inside a circuit. In its general form it reads: 
$$
\sum _{\nu =  0}^n V_{\nu} = 0
$$
The voltages can count positively or negatively, depending on their direction relative to the mesh. 
$$
\downarrow\downarrow \iff +V \ \ bzw. \ \ \downarrow \uparrow \iff -V
$$
Together with [[Kirchhoff's Current Law]] is used in [[DC-Network-Analysis]].

$$
V_{01} - V_{R1} + V_{02} - V_{R2} +V_{R3}-V_{R4} = 0
$$
