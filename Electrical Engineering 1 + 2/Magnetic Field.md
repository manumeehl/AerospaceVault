A magnetic field is is a field in space with infinite range that can interact with other magnetic fields and affect [[Charge|charges]]. It can be caused by a number of things in nature: 
- [[Current]]: electromagnetism
- Rotating electrons in permanent magnets 
- Current if ionised liquids: earths magnetic field
$\rightarrow$ Moving charge carriers

The direction of the field lines in a conductor can be ascertained by the right hand rule: ![[Screenshot 2024-05-25 at 13.32.38.png]]
__Thumb__ $\rightarrow$ direction of current 
__Fingers__ $\rightarrow$ direction of field lines

----
The force on a conductor in a magnetic field can be calculated by: 
$$
F(t) = i(t) \cdot B(t) \cdot l
$$
Where $l$ is the length of the conductor in the magnetic field. 

----
The force of two conductors with a distance $a$ can be calculated by:
$$
F = \frac{\mu_0 \cdot l \cdot I_1 \cdot I_2}{2\pi \cdot a}
$$
