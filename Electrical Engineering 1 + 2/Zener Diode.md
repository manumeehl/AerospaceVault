#Component 
A Zener Diode is a special [[Diode]] that uses the Zener [[Diode#Breakdown Mechanisms|breakdown mechanism]]. 
![[Diode-and-Zener-Diode-2.png]]
Due to its small depletion region, once a certain reverse [[Voltage]], the breakdown voltage $V_{BR}$ is reached current can flow again. 
__Applications:__
1. Voltage limitation 
2. Voltage stabilisation
3. Design for operation in reverse direction
