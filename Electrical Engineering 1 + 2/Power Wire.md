A typical power line in power engineering consists of three separate and insulated wires inside: 
- __Line (L)__: conducts the [[Current]] from the [[Electric Energy Sources|power source]], typically brown, black, or grey 
- __Neutral (N)__: conductor for the return [[Current]] to the power source, blue 
- __Protective Earth (PE) or Ground__: path for [[Current]] in case of a short or other fault, yellow-green
