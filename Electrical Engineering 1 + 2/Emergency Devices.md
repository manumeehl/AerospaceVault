- Typical household fuse 
- Breaks circuit at a specified [[Current]] flowing over period of time 

#### Residual Current Protection

- Required in modern households and networks with more than 40$A$
- Monitors circuit for currents that do not flow back through the [[Power Wire|neutral]], i. e. through the ground or people

#### Arc Detection
