#Component 
A [[Semiconductors|semiconductor]] diode uses a [[Semiconductors#The p-n Junction|p-n junction]] to block current in one direction and conduct it in the other. ![[Diode-and-Zener-Diode-1.png]]
If a [[Voltage]] acts in the direction of the diode (Anode $\rightarrow$ Cathode, p-type $\rightarrow$ n-type) and is large enough to overcome the [[Electric Field|electric potential]] of the depletion layer current can flow through the diode. Note that for small voltages the diode may therefore still block [[Current]] if the potential cannot be overcome. 
If the voltage acts in the opposite direction the electric field is bolstered and current is therefore blocked.

### Breakdown Mechanisms

When the voltage in the reverse direction is high, the current increases sharply above a certain value.

#### Breakdown Types
1. __Avalanche Breakdown__: Charge carriers generated by electron-hole pairs lead to even more electron-hole pairs by collisions with atoms of the grid
2. __Tunnel or Zener Breakdown__: High doping results in a small depletion region, allowing charge carriers to tunnel directly from the valence band into conduction band 
3. __Thermal Breakdown__: Destruction of the component if the permitted power dissipation of the diode is exceeded

The tunnel breakdown is used in [[Zener Diode|Zener diodes]].
