[[Capacitor|Capacitors]] connected in parallel have the following properties: 
$$
v_1(t) = v_2(t) = v_3(t) = \ ... \ = v_n(t) = v(t)
$$
$$
i(t)= \sum_{\nu = 1}^n i_\nu(t) = C_{tot} \cdot \frac{dv(t)}{dt}
$$
$$
C_{tot} = \sum_{\nu = 1}^nC_\nu
$$
This is analogously to the [[Resistor Series Connection]].
