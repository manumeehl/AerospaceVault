The magnetic field strength is one of the three characteristics of magnetic fields, next to [[Magnetic Flux Density]] and [[Magnetic Flux]]. The magnetic field strength of conductor can calculated using [[Ampère's Law]]. It can be calculated from the magnetic flux density: 
$$
H = \frac{B}{\mu_0\mu_r}
$$
