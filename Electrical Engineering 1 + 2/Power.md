### Definition of Power
The relationship between electrical power $P(t)$ and electrical [[Energy]] $W(t)$ is: 
$$
P = U \cdot I
$$
$$
P(t) = \frac{dW(t)}{dt} \iff W(t) = \int P(t) \ dt
$$
For mechanical settings the power can also be calculated with the torque and angular speed: 
$$
P = \omega \cdot T
