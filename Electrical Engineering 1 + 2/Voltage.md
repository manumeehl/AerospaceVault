### Definition of Voltage
Voltage causes a current flow in the consumer. It describes the energy required to transport a given quantity of [[Charge]]: 
$$
V = \frac{W}{Q}
$$

### Volt \[$V$]
$$
1V = 1 \frac{J}{As} = 1 \frac{W}{A}
$$
Voltage, [[Resistance]], and [[Current]] are connected by [[Ohm's Law]].
$$
U = R \cdot I
$$
