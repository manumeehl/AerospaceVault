$$
\oint_L \vec{H}d\vec{l} = \sum I_{enclosed} \iff H(r) = \frac{I}{2\pi r}
$$
Where $r$ is the distance to the conductor, $I$ is the [[Current]], and $H$ is the [[Magnetic Field Strength]].

### Example: Toroidal Coil with N Turns

$$
H(r) = \frac{\Theta}{2 \pi r} = \frac{N \cdot I }{2 \pi r}
$$
As one can see, each turn multiplies the [[Magnetic Field Strength]] of the coil which is the reason for wound wires in applications where a strong [[Magnetic Field]] is desired. One should also note the presence of the [[Magnetomotive Force]]: $\Theta = N \cdot I$
