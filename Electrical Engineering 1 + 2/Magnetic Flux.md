The notion of magnetic flux is difficult to grasp, formally it is defined as: 
$$
\Phi = \iint_A \vec{B}  \ d\vec{A}
$$
Or simply put: 
$$
\Phi = B \cdot A
$$
Which is just the [[Magnetic Flux Density]] over the entire surface area. However, its meaning becomes more obvious when looking at [[Magnetic Circuit|magnetic circuits]] as there it is the magnetic analog to [[Current|electrical current]]. One could speak of magnetic current.
