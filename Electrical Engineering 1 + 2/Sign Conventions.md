#Convention 
If the [[Voltage]] of the [[Resistor]] is opposite to the [[Voltage]] of the [[Electric Energy Sources|generator]] the active sign convention is used. 
$$
V_{t} - V_{0}+R_{i}\cdot I =0
$$
$$
\implies V_{t} = V_{0} - R_{i} \cdot I
$$
If the [[Voltage]] of the [[Resistor]] is in the same direction as the [[Voltage]] of the [[Electric Energy Sources|motor]] the passive sign convention is used. 
$$
V_{t} - V_{0}-R_{i}\cdot I =0
$$
$$
\implies V_{t} = V_{0} + R_{i} \cdot I
$$
