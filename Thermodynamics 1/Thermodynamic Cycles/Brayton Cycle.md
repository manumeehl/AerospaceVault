#Cycle 
>Ideal [[Thermodynamic Cycle]] for gas turbines

### Characteristics
__Open__ Cycle
Working Fluid: Air\
Combustion: Air + Fuel
### Formulas
$W_{net} = W_{out} - W_{in}$ 
$\Delta u = 0 = q_{23} + q_{41} - w_{net}$
$=> q_{23} + q_{41} = q_{in} - q_{out}$

From energy balance equation for isobaric processes:
$q_{23} = c_p * (T_3 - T_2)$ and $q_{41} = c_p * (T_1 - T_4)$

### Cycle Process
1. [[Isentropic Process|Isentropic]] compression
2. [[Isobaric Process|Isobaric]] Heat Addition ($Q_{in}$, $Q_{23})$
3. [[Isentropic Process|Isentropic]]  expansion
4. [[Isobaric Process|Isobaric]]  Heat rejection ($Q_{out}$, $Q_{41}$)

### Idealization
- Viewed as a closed cycle with
	- Combustion Chamber as Heat Addition
	- Exhaust as Heat Rejection

### Process steps: 
*Process 1 → 2*: Isentropic Compression
*Process 2 → 3*: Heat Addition
*Process 3* → 4 Isentropic Expansion
*Process 4 → 1 Heat Rejection*
