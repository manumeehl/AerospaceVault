> Ideal Compression Ignition Engine

### Energy Conversion
Fuel & Air Mixture + Spark Plug -> Thermal Energy -> Mechanical Energy

### Differences to Otto-Cycle
- No spark plugs
- Fuel auto-ignites above a certain pressure
- No instantaneous combustion, gradual fuel flow- and ignition
-
### Four-Stroke-Process
Stroke 1: Compression Stroke
Stroke 2: Power Stroke
Stroke 3: Exhaust Stroke
Stroke 4: Intake Stroke
