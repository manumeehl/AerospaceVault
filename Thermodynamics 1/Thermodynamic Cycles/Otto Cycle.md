#Cycle 

> Ideal Cycle of Gasoline / Internal Combustion Engine

### Energy Conversion
Fuel & Air Mixture + Spark Plug -> Thermal Energy -> Mechanical Energy

### Engine
Piston-Cylinder Device
"Four-Stroke-Engine"

### Four-Stroke-Process
Stroke 1: Compression Stroke
Stroke 2: Expansion / Power Stroke
Stroke 3: Exhaust Stroke
Stroke 4: Intake Stroke

### Idealized Otto Cycle
- Ideal processes for all four stages (Two Strokes)
- Gases -> Air (Instead of Air + Fuel)

1. First stroke: [[Isentropic Process|Isentropic]] compression process ([[Heat Exchange|Adiabatic]] and reversible)
2. Ignition: [[Isochoric process|Isochoric]] heat addition
3. Stroke 2: [[Isentropic Process|Isentropic]] expansion process ([[Heat Exchange|Adiabatic]] and reversible)
4. Exhaust: [[Isochoric process|Isochoric]] heat rejection

### Energy Analysis

Compression: $w_{in} = u_2 - u_1$
Expansion: $w_{out} = u_3 - u_4$
Heat Addition: $q_{in} = u_3 - u_2$
Heat Rejection: $q_{out} = u_4 - u_1$

This results in the [[Process efficiencies|thermal efficiency]]:
$$\eta_{th} = \frac{w_{net}}{q_{in}} = \frac{W_{out} - W_{in}}{q_{in}}$$
