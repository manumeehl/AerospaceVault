The efficiency of a process is related to its reversibility. (closer to reversibility -> more efficient)
*Full reversibility is an idealization*

$$0 \le Isentropic Efficiency \le 1$$

Performance of a cycle: Energy input or output


### Example 1: Turbines
Real Turbine Work < Isentropic turbine work
Isentropic efficiency: $$\frac{Work_R}{Work_I}$$
### Example 2: Compressors / Pumps
Real Compressor Work > Isentropic compressor work
Isentropic efficiency: $$\frac{Work_I}{Work_R}$$
