### Spatial State
1 [[Phase]]:     homogenous
2+ [[Phase|Phases]]: heterogenous

### Temporal Behavior
- Properties and behavior stay constant: __Steady System/Process__
- Properties and behavior change: __Unsteady System/Process__

### Boundary Behavior

### System Energy

>There exists, for every thermodynamic system, a property called energy. The energy of a system can only change through energy transport across its boundaries.
