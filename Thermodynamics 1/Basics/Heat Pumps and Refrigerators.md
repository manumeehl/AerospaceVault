> Reverse heat engine process "Work into Heat"

__2 Types of objectives__:
 - Het pump -> Provide heat to the warmer 
 - Refrigerator -> Extract heat from the cold side

### Heat pump Efficiency
$$COP_{HP} = \frac{Q_{out}}{W_{in}} = \frac{Q_{in} + W_{net}}{W_{in}}$$
### Refrigerator Efficiency
$$COP_{Ref} = \frac{Q_{in}}{W_{in}}$$
