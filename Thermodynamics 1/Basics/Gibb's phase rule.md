#Method
To find out how many degrees of freedom a system has and how many dependent properties therefore need to be know, the Gibb's [[Phase|phase]] rule is used. 
$$n = \beta - \alpha + 2$$
- $n$ are the degrees of freedom 
- $\beta$ are the number of components (i.e. chemically different gases)
- $\alpha$ are the number of phases (i.e. steam and water for $H_2O$)
