> Reverse heat engine process "Work into Heat"


__Objectives__:
 - Heat pump -> Provide heat to the warmer side
 - Refrigerator -> Extract heat from the cold side

Usually implemented as [[Types of Cycles|closed cycles]].

### Heat pump Efficiency
$$COP_{HP} = \frac{Q_{out}}{W_{in}} = \frac{Q_{in} + W_{net}}{W_{in}}$$
### Refrigerator Efficiency
$$COP_{Ref} = \frac{Q_{in}}{W_{in}}$$
