### Different Compressor processes

Possibility 1:
- Pressure increase at constant volume
- Simultaneous work and heat addition

Possibility 2:
1. Isentropic compression -> only work
2. Isobaric expansion -> only heat

Easier to realize in reality

Sum of total work and heat is the same for both processes!
