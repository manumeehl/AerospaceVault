#Property

The (specific) heat capacity of a substance is defined as amount of heat that needs to be transferred to change the temperature by 1 Kelvin, or in its specific form, for 1 Kelvin and 1 kilogram.

Character: $C$

It generally holds that $$Q = C \cdot \delta T$$
Heat is path dependent â†’ Process of heat transfer has to be specified

### Special Cases

Specific heat capacity at constant __volume__:
$$c_v = \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial T}\right)_v = \left(\frac{\partial q}{\partial T}\right)_v$$
Specific heat capacity at constant __pressure__:
$$c_p = \left(\frac{\partial q}{\partial T}\right)_p = \left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial T}\right)_p$$
### Useful processes

1. Heat transfer at constant volume ($C \rightarrow C_v$)
2. Heat transfer at constant pressure ($C \rightarrow C_p$)
### Relevance
Although $c_v$ and $c_p$ are based on calculations in isochoric or isobaric processes, they should be thought of as thermodynamic properties of substances that __only__ depend on the state.

These values are extremely important in thermodynamic calculations and have been determined experimentally for a huge amount of simple compressible substances.
