#Property

>The (specific) heat capacity of a substance is defined as amount of heat that needs to be transferred to change the temperature by 1 Kelvin, or in its specific form, for 1 Kelvin and 1 kilogram.

Character: $C$

It generally holds that $$Q = C \cdot \delta T$$
Heat is path dependent → Process of heat transfer has to be specified

### Special Cases

Specific heat capacity at constant __volume__:
$$c_v = (\frac{\partial u}{\partial T})_v = (\frac{\partial q}{\partial T})_v$$
Specific heat capacity at constant __pressure__:
$$c_p = (\frac{\partial q}{\partial T})_p = (\frac{\partial h}{\partial T})_p$$
### Useful processes

1. Heat transfer at constant volume (𝐶 → 𝐶𝑣)
2. Heat transfer at constant pressure (𝐶 → 𝐶𝑝)

### Relevance
Although $c_v$ and $c_p$ are based on calculations in isochoric or isobaric processes, they should be thought of as thermodynamic properties of substances that __only__ depend on the state.

These values are extremely important in thermodynamic calculations and have been determined experimentally for a huge amount of simple compressible substances.
