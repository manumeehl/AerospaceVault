Extensive scalar property __S__
$$\delta S = \frac{\delta Q}{T}$$
- Entropy doesn't show amount of energy, but how useful it is.
- Entropy is a measure of how spread out energy is
	-> Concentrated energy -> low entropy -> useful energy
	-> Dispersed energy -> high entropy -> less useful energy

*Energy always goes from being concentrated to being dispersed.*
*Entropy moves with heat, but not with work*
