### General
Temperature is an [[Types of system properties|intensive property]] that defines how hot something is. Two units for temperature are in common use: Kelvin and Celsius. 

----
### Kelvin 
Kelvin \[$K$] is the scientific unit for temperature. It is defined with absolute zero and the triple point of water. Hence the lowest theoretical temperature in Kelvin is zero. Kelvin is used in almost all calculations and formulas and is therefore the preferred unit in thermodynamics. 

---
### Celsius
Degree Celsius \[$\degree C$], sometimes referred to as centigrade, is a unit for temperature historically defined by the freezing temperature of water and its boiling point. Therefore: 
$$
0 \ K = -273,15 \degree C
$$
----
__Note:__ Both units are proportional: 
$$
\Delta K \equiv \Delta \degree C
$$
