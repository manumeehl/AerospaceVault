### General
Volume is a unit of measure of how large something is. It is an [[Types of system properties|extensive property]] and given by some unit of length squared. Next to plain volume (with the base unit $m^3$) there is [[Mass|mass]] specific volume: 
$$
v = \frac{V}{m} = \frac{1}{\rho} 
$$
Note that this is equivalent to the inverse of density. In base units $v$ is given in $m^3/kg$.
Occasionally molar volume is also used: 
$$
v_m = \frac{V}{n}
$$
