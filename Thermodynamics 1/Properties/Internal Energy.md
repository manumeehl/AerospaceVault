#Property
Character: **u**

>The internal Energy u is an extensive property that represents the amount of energy stored on a microscopic level of unordered movements of molecules. This movement correlates with the fluid temperature

From the [[1st Law of thermodynamics]], the internal energy can be derived as $$\Delta U = Q + W$$
