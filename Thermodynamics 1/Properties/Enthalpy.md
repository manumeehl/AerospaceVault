#Property 
The Enthalpy **H** of a thermodynamic system is an extensive property and is defined as the sum of internal Energy and the product of its pressure and volume. It cannot be measured directly but instead Enthalpy deltas can be regarded as sort of thermodynamic potential.

Enthalpy = [[Internal Energy]] + [[Pressure]] * [[Volume]]
$$H=U+ p\cdot V$$
