#Property 
>The sum of the internal energy and the product of the pressure and volume of a thermodynamic system is called __enthalpy__. It is an energy-like property or state function - its value is determined entirely by the temperature, pressure, and composition of the system and not by its history

Enthalpy = [[Internal Energy]] + [[Pressure]] * [[Volume]]
$$H=U+ p\cdot V$$


For mass flows:
$$\dot m * (h_1 + h_2 + h_n) = \dot m * c_p * (T_1 + T_2 + T_n)$$
