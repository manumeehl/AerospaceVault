#Knowledge 
This is an overview of different process types and how they behave in the pV-Diagram. Knowing these types is very important as the derived assumption can make calculations significantly easier.

| Process Name                           | Constant Property | pV-Diagram             | Polytropic Index |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| __[[Isobaric Process\|Isobaric]]__     | [[Pressure]] p    | horizontal line        | $n = 0$          |
| __[[Isochoric process\|Isochoric]]__   | [[Volume]] V      | vertical line          | $n = \infty$     |
| __[[Isothermal process\|Isothermal]]__ | [[Temperature]] T | hyperbolic curve       | -                |
| __[[Isentropic Process\|Isentropic]]__ | [[Entropy]] s     | steep hyperbolic curve | $n = k$          |
A process is reversible if it is [[Isentropic Process|isentropic]].
