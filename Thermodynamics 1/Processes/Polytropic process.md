"Processes with [[The Ideal Gas|ideal gases]] of varying pressures"

### The polytropic process relation
$$pv^n = const$$
Combined with the ideal gas law this results in:
$$\frac{T_2} {T_1} = \left(\frac{V_2} {V_1}\right)^\frac {n-1} {n}$$

Todo: How does this relate in different scenarios?


### Work in a polytropic process
For general polytropic processes it holds that
$$W = \frac {P_2V_2 - P_1V_1}{1-n}$$
For the special case of an [[Isothermal process]] with [[Polytropic Index]] **n=1** this relation becomes $$W = pV \cdot ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V1}\right)$$
