### Work in an isobaric process
Referring to [[1st Law of thermodynamics]] we see that:

$$\Delta U = Q - W \implies W = Q - \Delta U$$
$$W = \int_{a}^{b} p \ dV$$
This formula is valid for **isobaric** and **non-isobaric** processes

With constant pressure this results in:
$$W = P_{m}(V_2 - V_1)$$
