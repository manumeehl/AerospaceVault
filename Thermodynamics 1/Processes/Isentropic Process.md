- Entropy stays constant $ΔS = 0$ (__Reversible__)
- No heat exchanged with environment $δQ = 0$ (__[[Heat Exchange|Adiabatic]]__)
- Change of internal energy is only achieved by work $U = δW$

### Examples
- Compression in [[Compressor|Compressors]] and [[Turbine|Turbines]] of Aero Engines

### Useful formulas
$$\frac{p_2}{p_1} = \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^{\frac{y}{y-1}}$$ and
$$\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left(\frac{v_2}{v_1}\right)^{y-1}$$
