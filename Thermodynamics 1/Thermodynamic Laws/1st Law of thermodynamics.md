#Law

> Energy cannot be created or destroyed.
This implies that the [[Internal Energy]] of a system can only change if energy flows over the system boundary.

$$\Delta E = \Delta U + \Delta E_{ex} = Q + W$$

where:
- $\Delta E$ = Change of energy
- $\Delta U$ = Change of internal energy
- $\Delta E_{ex}$ = Change of internal energy

[[Internal Energy]] = [[Heat (transfer)]] - [[Work]]
$$\Delta U = Q - W$$
or:
$$\Delta U = \Delta Q + \Delta W = \Delta Q - p * \Delta V$$
- $\Delta Q$ = Change of Thermal Energy
- p = presure
- $\Delta V$ = Chagne in Volume

With infinitesimal process speed and conservation of energy this results in 
$$\delta Q = \delta U + \delta W $$
