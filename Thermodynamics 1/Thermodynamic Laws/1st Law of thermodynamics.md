#Law

> Energy cannot be created or destroyed.
This implies that the [[Internal Energy]] of a system can only change if energy flows over the system boundary.

$$\Delta E = \Delta U + \Delta E_{ex} = Q + W$$

where:
- $\Delta E$ = Change of energy
- $\Delta U$ = Change of internal energy
- $\Delta E_{ex}$ = Change of internal energy

[[Internal Energy]] = [[Heat (transfer)]] - [[Work]]
$$\delta U = Q - W$$

With infinitesimal process speed and conservation of energy this results in 
$$\delta Q = \delta U + \delta W $$
