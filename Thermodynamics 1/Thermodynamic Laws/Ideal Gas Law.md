### What is an ideal gas? 
An [[The Ideal Gas|ideal gas]] is an idealised model of gases where all gases show the same behaviour. Furthermore, it is assumed that gas particles have no volume, all their energy is kinetic, and all collisions are fully elastic. For relatively low pressures these assumptions are a very good approximation of ideal gases.

### The Ideal Gas Law
__Molar Form:__
$$
pv_m = R_m T \iff pV = nR_mT
$$
__Mass Form:__
$$
pv = RT \iff pV = mRT
$$
With $R_m$ being the universal gas constant: 
$$
R_m = 8,314 \frac{J}{mol \cdot K}
$$
And $R$ being the specific gas constant: 
$$
R = \frac{R_m}{M}
$$
$M$ being the [[Molar Mass|molar mass]].
