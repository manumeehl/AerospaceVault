### Assumptions
1. The gas consists of a large number of small, identical particles (atoms or molecules) that are in random motion.
2. The volume occupied by the gas particles is negligible compared to the total volume of the gas.
3. There are no attractive or repulsive forces between the gas particles, except during brief, direct collisions.
4. The collisions between the gas particles with other gas particles or container walls are perfectly elastic.
5. The average kinetic energy of the gas particles is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas.
