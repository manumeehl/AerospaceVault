>Ideal gas is an idealized model of a real gas. For ideal gases, all gases show the same behaviour. It is assumed, that the gas particles have no volume, all their energy is kinetic energy and all collisions are fully elastic. For relatively low pressures ideal gases show a good approximation to real gases.

#### Assumptions
1. The gas consists of a large number of small, identical particles (atoms or molecules) that are in random motion.
2. The volume occupied by the gas particles is negligible compared to the total volume of the gas.
3. There are no attractive or repulsive forces between the gas particles, except during brief, direct collisions.
4. The collisions between the gas particles with other gas particles or container walls are perfectly elastic.
5. The average kinetic energy of the gas particles is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas.

### The Ideal Liquid

Ideal liquid is an idealized model of a real liquid. It is assumed, that the liquid is incompressible and inviscid. Therefore;
$$
v(p) \approx const.
$$
$$
v(T) \approx const.
